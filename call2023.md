-   FMI in Modelica and non-Modelica applications and tools

Please see the  [Authors' Guide](authors.html) for further information.
Information about the submission website are coming soon.

The conference proceedings will be published by the Modelica Association on its website and by  [Linköping University Electronic Press](http://www.ep.liu.se/)..
Each paper will be individually referenced by a DOI.

## Call for Libraries

You are encouraged to submit a  **free Modelica application library**  in Modelica source code form.
The library should be sent to the program chair ([mc15@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de](mailto:mc15@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de)) and provided under the [3-clause BSD License for the Modelica Association](https://modelica.org/licenses/modelica-3-clause-bsd).
Please submit also a corresponding paper to the conference.
If the paper gets accepted, you can present your library at the conference.

Libraries are evaluated according to the following criteria:

-   How useful is the library for the Modelica community, especially for industrial applications?
-   Basic design principle of the library (e.g. physical components are modeled in a declarative way and there are no un-physical restrictions how components can be connected together).
-   Completeness and extent of the library (small or large library, examples).
-   Usage of the library (component documentation, users guide, parameter menus, etc.)

Accepted libraries will be included on the conference stick and linked from the Modelica web site.
